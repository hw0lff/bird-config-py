# bird config python

A simple incomplete library to generate static bird configuration files with python.

The missing protocols should be relatively easy to implement with this foundation.

It's primarily serves its purpose at [AG DSN](https://agdsn.de/).

Has been used with python3.12 and bird 2.0.12.

**Have fun!**

## Examples
The `bird_config_example.py` contains examples of how to use this library.
It creates some random example configuration that I hacked together in little time.
